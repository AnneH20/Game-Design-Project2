# Time Wars  
A two-player fighting game which allows players to battle against each other with different characters

Fight against your friend and see who comes out on top! Use a shared keyboard and press keys to fight each other. Each player is granted 3 lives and there's a 3 minute timer set.
After your lives run out or the timer runs out, the game is over.

## Play Screen:
  Each player starts out with a full health bar which is displayed at the top of the screen

  Once a player wins or the timer runs out, the Game Over Screen will pop up
